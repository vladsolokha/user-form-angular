Notes on test completion

received link from Bill
https://trello.com/c/3DklPIG8/9-0009-frontend-add-edit-and-delete-icons-to-the-user-search-component

cloned app from trello
made github repo for me to save versions to
first commit pushed to remote so I can access on other computers
https://github.com/vladsolokha/user-form-angular

npm i

needed angular cli so in terminal $ npm install -g @angular/cli

googled material.angular.io/components documentation as reference to help build app

https://material.angular.io/components/categories

npm serve

played with the app, to understand problem and see how it functions

created 2 buttons, 'edit' and 'delete' in /src/user/user-search/user-search.component.html
made them different colors according to documentation

===---the above took me maybe 20 min---===

the below is not so easy. 
received message from Bill saying backend was messed up. 
local port 9999 is not being received by app local port 3200

received a java backend. Make it work by download/install Java 11 and mvn

struggled to figure out Maven installation on Mac; specifically environment variables 
and adding mvn's bin directory of apache-maven to the PATH env variables
used vim to edit .bash_profile and add PATH 

Had easier time with windows configuration of the above

But finally, can focus on editing backend and frontend, connecting the two and plugging and chugging.

Removed tool tips because not needed due to words are already on button UIs

Moved to 'getting route information'
if name is selected from table and if user clicks on edit button 
then route information from user-search.component to user-form.component to edit

using https://angular.io/guide/router#getting-route-information
as a guide to understand how components are routed

using https://angular.io/guide/router#fetch-data-before-navigating
to understand how to get data from table and route to form component

found similar app from Jason Watmore https://jasonwatmore.com/post/2020/12/15/angular-11-crud-example-with-reactive-forms#users-add-edit-component-ts
cloned his github repo and tried to understand how his edit button works to pre-populate form Fields

looks like his is the closest I've gotten. 
with the fakeBackend he helps me understand how front/back are connected

I'm thinking that I need to access the backend user id and when user is selected from table
I'll use the id data to route to the form component user id's name object
All this is routerLinked when the edit button is clicked

I need to figure out how backend is talking with frontend to pinpoint access to user id

learned what services and DI are:
service is class with narrow, well-defined purpose as to increase modularity and reusability
service can inject their process/value/function/feature into any component which makes them readily available
use @injectable() decorator to allow injection of service into component as dependency (class)

UserFacade is a service used in user-search that uses a method dispatchRetrieve()

learned what store from ngrx is:
it is a way to globally store state and manage it in the app
this reading really helped me understand why store and global state management is important
https://medium.com/@veeralpatel/things-ive-learned-about-state-management-for-react-apps-174b8bde87fb
however, the reading is mostly noting React, Redux, and MobX state management tools
I need one with more specific documentation on ngrx 
https://ngrx.io/guide/  is better

Next I read some more on different parts of the app
I found Angular has types: class,const,decorator,directive,interface,pipe,ngmodule,etc
I examined some of the ones used in the app

I searched backend and found UserController has create/retrieve/update/delete decorators

Got call from Ryan
He hinted to use the Angular.io documentation specifically tour of heroes
Which I completed a while ago, so I went back and re-read the tutorial docs
I found something that could potentially be what I'm trying to solve
https://angular.io/guide/forms

Good info but not what I was looking for

Going to read https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt6
Probably closest I will get. Will read the part about "update heroes" section
Which I speculate will work like my edit button. 

Next read about click event binding. click event handler

What needs to happen is...
1. from selected row add click handler to point to search component method
    line 26, (click)='clickedRow(row)'
2. the method will store the User.name in search component
    line 55-58, I should try outputting result? IT WORKS
3. form component will @input the method from the other component
4. name will need to be separtated into f,m,l
5. interpolation or prop binding will diplay names in each box on HTML templateUrl

Logic above is bad

Use click handlers on the icons to trigger actions.
Use router.navigate feature inside click handler in ts to navigate
to the new component and pass the id in the url
On new component (form.ts) read the id from url
use the value to make service call (or NgRx store select) to load entire object
with the given id. 
write a method that returns observable of name 

display object's fName, mName (if exists), lName
